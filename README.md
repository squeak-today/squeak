# Squeak: Language Learning By Reading What You Love üê≠

## üåçüìö What is Squeak?
**Squeak** is a language learning platform with any story or news article you want to read, and written at your level.

It's been shown that language learning is most effective when you understand ~80% of the words in a text. Unlike Duolingo, Babbel, or other language learning apps, Squeak is built to provide content that you will *enjoy* and *understand*.

Squeak content is:
- **Tailored**: Pick a specific difficulty level ([CEFR](https://danteinlinea.com/blog/en/the-cefr-levels/)) for YOUR proficiency. No need to read frustratingly simple stories or things with way too many big words. Learn at a healthy pace.
- **Fascinating**: Read fiction, today's news, or even a fascinating recounting of the 2016 NBA Finals...
- **Easy**: Click a word and get its translation *instantly*, along with the sentence around it. No need for a book on the left, dictionary on the right.
- **Native**: Read stories based on a model fine-tuned on content written by native, professional writers.

# Squeak Story Generation and REST API Backend

## Developer Setup

### `/supabase` (semi-optional)
Contains migrations and code to interact with Supabase via code if needed.
Needs a `.env` file with the following format:
```shell
SUPABASE_HOST = "..."
SUPABASE_PORT = "..."
SUPABASE_USER = "..."
SUPABASE_PASSWORD = "..."
SUPABASE_DATABASE = "..."
```

This folder is semi-optional as its not needed to test in development, but migrations are still recorded in the repo.

### Deploy API
These instructions are for deployment using Squeak's official domain and already existing Supabase.
If you are viewing this as an open source user, some of these may not apply. You will need to create your own Supabase instance and, if desired, a domain for the API.

1. Build Go binaries with `./build-for-lambda.sh` in all lambda directories which compiles, zips, and places in `infrastructure/`.

2. See `infrastructure/WORKSPACES.md` for instructions on how to deploy/update the infrastructure.

4. The `queue_filler` lambda will be invoked automatically at regular intervals, but you may invoke it early for testing story generation-tied features.

5. **IMPORTANT**: All API endpoints need to be called with a `Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>` header.

## Examples: `api.squeak.today`
> https://api.squeak.today/news?language=French&cefr=B2&subject=Politics&page=1&pagesize=10
>https://api.squeak.today/story?language=French&cefr=B2&subject=Politics&page=1&pagesize=10

## Adding New Languages
1. Add language to `queue_filler/main.go` as part of the `languages` array.
2. Add language to `lambda/main.go` as part of the `language_ids` map. Note that the language ID is the language code used by Google Translate API, e.g "fr" for French.
3. Update LLMs to fine-tuning on the new language.
