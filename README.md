# Squeak - Languagee Learning Through Stories You Love! 🐭

## 🌍📚 What is Squeak?
**Squeak** is a language learning platform with any story or news article you want to read, and written at your level.

It's been shown that language learning is most effective when you understand ~80% of the words in a text. Unlike Duolingo, Babbel, or other language learning apps, Squeak is built to provide content that you will *enjoy* and *understand*.

Squeak content is:
- **Tailored**: Pick a specific difficulty level ([CEFR](https://danteinlinea.com/blog/en/the-cefr-levels/)) for YOUR proficiency. No need to read frustratingly simple stories or things with way too many big words. Learn at a healthy pace.
- **Fascinating**: Read fiction, today's news, or even a fascinating recounting of the 2016 NBA Finals...
- **Easy**: Click a word and get its translation *instantly*, along with the sentence around it. No need for a book on the left, dictionary on the right.
- **Native**: Read stories based on a model fine-tuned on content written by native, professional writers.
